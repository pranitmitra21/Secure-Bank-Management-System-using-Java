# Secure-Bank-Management-System-using-Java

ðŸ“˜ About the Project
The Secure Bank Management System is a console-based Java application designed to simulate core banking functionalities. It allows users to register, securely log in using a 4-digit PIN, and perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing funds. The system uses an embedded SQLite database for data persistence and includes a simple admin login for managing and monitoring all user accounts.

This project demonstrates practical Java skills, JDBC for database interaction, and basic security and data validation techniquesâ€”making it a strong addition to your placement portfolio.
